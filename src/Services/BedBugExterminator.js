              <p>
                Bed bugs are pests that are commonly found near beds and can be
                difficult to eradicate for the typical individual. To survive,
                these pests depend on the blood of warm-blooded creatures, such
                as humans (pain!).
              </p>

              <p>
                Bed bugs grow in 35 days and have a lifespan of seven to twelve
                months. This makes bed insect control difficult, especially
                without the assistance of a professional bed bug exterminator.
              </p>

              <p>
                Residential and commercial bed bug control is available from a
                number of pest control companies. Quality Affordable Pest
                Control, on the other hand, is the number one choice for bed bug
                eradication if you want a high-quality overall solution for bed
                bug extermination.

              <p>
                One of the first pest control firms in Canada to use this
                non-toxic bed bug treatment method is Quality Affordable Pest
                Control. It kills bed bugs in homes and businesses in a safer,
                more effective, and faster manner, preventing an infestation or

              </p>
              <p>
                Natural Beauveria bassiana fungal spores are picked up by bed
                bugs and carried back to their harborage or breeding locations
                with Aprehend®. These fungus spores are easily passed from one
                bed insect to the next. All bed bugs that come into contact with
                the spores will perish within ten days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aprehend® stands out from other bed bug treatments because of
                its long-lasting residual — it can last up to 3 months! This
                ensures that any new bed bugs introduced in a house or company
                in the three months following treatment will pick up the spores
                and perish before creating an infestation. It's a complete
                assurance. For more information, give us a call right now.

                <b> Bed Bug Control Preparation Check List:</b>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Remove clutter to minimise the number of hiding spots for
                  bedbugs. Any goods you no longer use should be bagged and
                  discarded in outside rubbish cans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove all bedding, linens, comforters, and pillows from your
                  beds and place them in plastic bags to be washed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mattresses and box springs should be free of any plastic
                  covers. Bed insect infestations are not protected by plastic
                  covers on mattresses or box springs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove all clothing and other items from drawers, nightstands,
                  closets, and other storage locations, and arrange them in
                  plastic bags to be washed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take down the drapes in the bedrooms. Also, place any loose
                  items or garments found outside of dressers, under mattresses,
                  or in closets in plastic bags to be washed. Remove all
                  paintings, photos, posters, and mirrors off the walls of your
                  bedroom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove vacuum bags and place them in outside trash cans. For
                  extermination treatment, your vacuum and other electrical
                  appliances should stay in place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any items stored under the bed should be thrown away or left
                  in place for the bed bug removal treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Aquariums can be left in place for at least six hours if the
                  filtration and aeration systems are switched off and the tank
                  is adequately covered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the bed bug exterminator leaves, all tenants, including
                  dogs, must leave the unit and not return for at least 4 to 6
                  hours. Instructions for Laundry:{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Empty all laundry bags into the washing machine immediately
                  and wash everything in a hot water cycle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use outdoor garbage cans to dispose of discarded plastic bags.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some goods that can't be washed can be disinfected
                  successfully in the dryer. Duffel bags, pocketbooks,
                  backpacks, teddy animals, and other soft objects are examples.
