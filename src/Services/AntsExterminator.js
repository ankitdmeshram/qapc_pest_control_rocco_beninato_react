                    <h4>Carpenter Ants
                    </h4>

                    <p>Carpenter ants live in wood and build their nests in a variety of wood sources, including rotten and fallen trees, old fence posts, and firewood that has been left outside to decay. Carpenter ants prefer to build their nests in rotting wood, which they regard as a tasty food source.</p>
                    <p>Carpenter ants love wood, but they aren't true predators because they don't eat the wood they eat. These ants have been found to build their nests in rotting wood, similar to the thief ant and the tiny black ant, which live in similar environments.</p>
                    <p>Insect pests such as ants are attracted to the moisture found in nearby trees, bushes, and other plants, and will begin to inhabit the structure. Soft, damp wood, such as dead or alive wood from trees or posts, as well as any sections of trees that have been cut away, make good nesting locations (for example, limbs and stumps).</p>
                    <p>The presence of sawdust under rotted wood can be used to identify carpenter ants. Ants don't usually go out of their way to cause damage to wood structures, although they can do so unintentionally.</p>

                    <h4>Indoors</h4>

                    <p>Carpenter ants are drawn to places with a small quantity of moisture or humidity, such as indoors.
                    </p>
                    <p>To protect against insect assault, all materials are left untreated, including wood panelled doors, wood cabinetry behind dishwashers, moist areas behind fireplaces, baseboards, and windows.</p>
