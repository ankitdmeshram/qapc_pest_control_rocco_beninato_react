                The preference of house centipedes is for dark, moist
                environments. As a result, homes with moisture issues are more
                likely to attract these pests. Centipedes can be found in
                basements, bathrooms, and closets. Centipedes have been seen to
                appear in sinks and bathtubs. Centipedes prey on other insects
                that live in the same locations as them. As a result, it's
                critical to ensure that your home is free of centipedes, as
                these pests may be extremely bothersome. And when it comes to
                the best centipede control option, you should only trust Quality
                Affordable Pest Control.
